&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The Pennsylvania Voter Registration App is the first of its kind in the country
– and only available in Pennsylvania – allowing canvassers to electronically register voters using
the Pennsylvania Department of State’s Online Web API. Pennsylvania Voice worked with Rock the Vote
and OSET’s TrustTheVote Project to build this first-of-its-kind app that feeds registrations
directly into the innovative PA online voter registration system, developed by the Pennsylvania
Department of State.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This mobile application “app” was built by Rock the Vote and OSET’s TrustTheVote Project
to facilitate the submission of electronic voter registration applications in the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania. It is an extension of Rock the Vote’s national, open source, online voter registration
platform. All Rock the Vote partners using the app are bound by its
<a href="https://www.rockthevote.com/get-involved/register-voters/">Terms of Use</a>
and the
<a href="http://www.dos.pa.gov/VotingElections/OtherServicesEvents/Pages/PA-Online-Voter-Registration-Web-API---RFC.aspx">Terms of Services </a>
outlined by the Pennsylvania Secretary of State’s office
</p>
<p>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Pennsylvania Voice, Rock the Vote and their partners are deploying a pilot
project in the fall of 2016 to see how this technology works in practice and measure its cost
savings. To learn more about the 2016 Pennsylvania Voter Registration App,
contact <a href="mailto:ovrtool@rockthevote.com">ovrtool@rockthevote.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Rock the Vote is the largest nonpartisan, nonprofit organization in the country driving the
youth vote to the polls. Since 1990, Rock the Vote has fused pop culture, music, art and technology
to fulfill its mission of building long-term youth political power. During the past six Presidential
elections, Rock the Vote ran the largest voter registration drives for young people and has
partnered with more than 25,000 partners through its online, multilingual voter registration
platform.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The TrustTheVote Project is an initiative of the OSET Foundation, Inc., a tax-exempt 501©(3)
nonprofit California public benefit corporation. It is focused on advancing electoral technology
innovation to improve the voting experience and increase the integrity of elections and their
outcomes.
